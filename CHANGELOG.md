## [0.2.7] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed

- **Response Truncation** - Prevent "Tool result could not be submitted" errors
  - `midnight-get-file`: Now truncates files >50KB to prevent MCP response overflow
  - `midnight-get-file-at-version`: Same truncation applied
  - `midnight-compare-syntax`: Truncates both old/new content if >50KB
  - `midnight-get-latest-syntax`: Truncates syntax files for non-Compact repos
  - All truncated responses include `truncated: true` flag for transparency

### Added

- **Line-Range Parameters** - Request specific sections of large files
  - `midnight-get-file` now accepts `startLine` and `endLine` parameters
  - Allows precise extraction without full file retrieval
  - Useful for navigating truncated files

- **Smart Truncation with Agent Guidance** - Language-aware content preservation
  - **Compact files**: keeps 80% from top (40KB) + 20% from bottom (10KB)
    - Pragma and imports are critical for compilation, prioritized
  - **TypeScript/JS files**: balanced 50/50 split (25KB each)
    - Preserves imports at top AND exports at bottom
  - Clear marker in truncated content shows exact line numbers omitted
  - `agentGuidance` field provides:
    - `whatYouHave`: Description of content the agent received (with percentage breakdown)
    - `whatIsMissing`: Exact line range and byte count of omitted content
    - `howToGetMore`: Instructions for retrieving missing content
    - `suggestedNextCalls`: Pre-computed `startLine`/`endLine` params to request omitted sections
  - Enables agents to autonomously continue reading if needed

- **Truncation Logging** - Monitor truncation events
  - `logger.info` emitted when content is truncated
  - Includes repository, path, original size, and omitted line range
  - Helps tune the 50KB limit based on real usage

## [0.1.41] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed

- **Version sync**: `CURRENT_VERSION` now reads from `package.json` automatically
  - No more manual updates needed when bumping version
  - Fixes stale version reporting in health checks and update notifications

## [0.1.40] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Map/Set operations documentation was WRONG**
  - `Map.lookup()` IS available in circuits (previously documented as unavailable)
  - `Map.member()` IS available in circuits (previously documented as unavailable)
  - `Set.member()` IS available in circuits (previously documented as unavailable)
  - Verified against OpenZeppelin contracts and real compiler behavior

### Added

- **New compiler error patterns** with fixes:
  - `cannot cast from type Uint<64> to type Bytes<32>` → Use `(amount as Field) as Bytes<32>`
  - `expected type Uint<64> but received Uint<0..N>` → Cast arithmetic: `(a + b) as Uint<64>`
  - `potential witness-value disclosure must be declared` → Disclose params: `const d = disclose(param)`

- **Type casting rules** in `TYPE_COMPATIBILITY`:
  - `Uint<64> → Bytes<32>`: Must go through Field first
  - `Uint<N> → Field`: Direct cast allowed
  - Arithmetic results need explicit cast back to target type

- **Arithmetic result type documentation**:
  - `Uint<64> + Uint<64>` produces `Uint<0..36893488147419103230>`
  - Must cast back: `(a + b) as Uint<64>`

### Changed

- **Tool description updated** - `midnight-get-latest-syntax` now shows:
  - "🚨 CALL THIS BEFORE GENERATING ANY COMPACT CODE!"
  - Lists Map.lookup/Set.member as available in circuits
  - Emphasizes disclose() requirement for circuit params

- **Prompts enhanced** with new compiler error patterns:
  - `create-contract` prompt includes type casting rules
  - `debug-contract` prompt includes new error→fix mappings

### Removed

- Duplicate anti-hallucination tools (getSampleContract, verifyCompactSyntax)
  - Functionality already exists in `midnight-get-latest-syntax`

## [0.1.39] - 2025-12-27

### Added

  - New API endpoint: `POST /v1/track/tool`
  - Dashboard shows: Tool Calls metric, Tool Usage chart, Recent Tool Calls table
  - Fire-and-forget tracking (doesn't slow down tool responses)

## [0.1.38] - 2025-12-26

### Changed

- **Deprecated auto-update tool** - Clarified that AI cannot auto-update config
  - AI runs in sandbox without filesystem access
  - Updated all prompts to give manual update instructions
  - Tool still exists but returns manual instructions

## [0.1.37] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

  - Wrong: `witness fn(): T { return ...; }`
  - Correct: `witness fn(): T;`

- **Pure circuit syntax** - Use "pure circuit" not "pure function"
  - Wrong: `pure function helper(): T`
  - Correct: `pure circuit helper(): T`

## [0.1.36] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- **Enum dot notation** - Compact uses dot notation, not Rust-style ::
  - Wrong: `Choice::rock`, `GameState::waiting`
  - Correct: `Choice.rock`, `GameState.waiting`

## [0.1.35] - 2025-12-26

### Added

- **Built-in Functions Reference** - Clear distinction between stdlib functions vs patterns
  - `persistentHash`, `persistentCommit`, `pad`, `disclose`, `assert` are BUILT-IN
  - `public_key()` is NOT built-in - must use persistentHash pattern
  - `verify_signature`, `random` are NOT built-in - must use witnesses

- **Type Compatibility Matrix** - What types can be compared/operated together
  - Field vs Uint comparisons require casting
  - Uint<0..N> for bounded parameters
  - Safe vs unsafe casts documented

- **Ledger Type Limits in Circuits** - What operations work where
  - Counter: `increment/decrement` ✓, `value()` ✗
  - Map: `insert/remove` ✓, `lookup/member` ✗
  - Set: `insert/remove` ✓, `member` ✗
  - Includes workaround patterns using witnesses

- **Common Compilation Errors** - Actual error messages with fixes
  - "unbound identifier public_key" → use persistentHash pattern
  - "incompatible combination of types Field and Uint" → cast or use bounded params
  - "operation value undefined for Counter" → use witness or TypeScript SDK

### Fixed

- **Incorrect Counter/Map/Set documentation** - Removed claims that `.value()`, `.lookup()`, `.member()` work in circuits (they don't)
- **Incomplete commit-reveal pattern** - Now includes complete, validated example with pragma

## [0.1.34] - 2025-12-26

  - `unexported_enum` - warns about enums not accessible from TypeScript
  - `deprecated_cell_wrapper` - catches `Cell<T>` (deprecated since 0.15)

- **Smarter agent workflow** - Prompts now enforce syntax checking before/after generation
  - `create-contract` prompt: Must call `midnight-get-latest-syntax` BEFORE generating
  - `review-contract` prompt: Must call `midnight-extract-contract-structure` FIRST to validate
  - `debug-contract` prompt: Must run static analysis to catch P0 errors first
  - All prompts instruct agents to fix P0 errors before returning code to user
